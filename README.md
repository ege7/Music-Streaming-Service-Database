# Music-Streaming-Service-Database

The original goal of our project was to create a system that would keep track of a user's music listening habits in order to recommend songs based on their playlists. However, we decided to pivot and focus on building a database that could store detailed information about various songs, albums, and artists. This database would allow users to search for and select songs for their playlists using various filters.



The project now consists of an interface that allows the user to manage and query this database of music information through a main page with buttons for adding and viewing records. This interface is intended to be used with the music streaming service Spotify.
